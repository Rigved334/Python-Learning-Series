Notes

1. Tuple Characteristics
Immutability: Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change, add, or remove elements once they are defined.

Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().

Single Element Tuple: To create a tuple with only one element, you must include a trailing comma (e.g., (10,)). Without the comma, Python treats it as the data type of the element itself (like an integer) rather than a tuple.

Error on Modification: Attempting to assign a new value to a tuple index (e.g., T1[1] = 20) will result in a TypeError because tuples do not support item assignment.

2. Built-in Tuple Functions
Many functions used with tuples are the same as those used with lists:

len(): Returns the number of items in the tuple.

count(): Returns the number of times a specified value occurs.

index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

sorted(): Returns a new sorted list from the tuple elements (note: it returns a list, not a tuple).

3. Additional Functions Demonstrated
max(): Returns the largest item in the tuple.

min(): Returns the smallest item in the tuple.



Examples

t1 = ("name", "age", "address")
t2 = (5, 6, 7, 8)

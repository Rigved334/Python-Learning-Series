Official Source: Visit Python.org to download the software.

Version Recommendation: It is recommended to install a stable version (like the 64-bit Windows installer) rather than the absolute latest, which may be unstable.

Installation Tip: Ensure all checkboxes (specifically "Add Python to PATH") are ticked before clicking Install Now.

Verification: To check if the installation was successful, open the Command Prompt and type python --version.

Object Oriented Programming in Python

1. Core Concepts
Class: A blueprint for an object that represents its properties (attributes/variables) and actions (behaviors/methods)

Syntax: class ClassName: followed by variables and methods.

Convention: It is recommended to use PascalCase (capitalizing the first letter) for class names for better readability.

Object: Also known as an "instance of a class," it is the physical existence of a class. You store an object in a reference variable to access class attributes.

Methods: These are essentially functions defined inside a class.

2. Special Parameters & Methods
Constructor (__init__): A special method that automatically runs when an object is created. Its purpose is to declare and initialize variables to prevent "garbage values"

self Parameter: A default argument that always points to the current object being created or used. It is used to access instance variables and methods within the class.

3. Implementation Example
The video demonstrates creating a Student class:

Initialization: The __init__ method takes self, name, and roll_number as arguments.

Attributes: Assigned using self.name = name and self.roll_number = roll_number.

Display Method: A display_info method prints the student's details using self to reference the specific instance's data.

Creating Objects: You can create multiple unique objects (e.g., s1, s2) from the same class, each holding different data.

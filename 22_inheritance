Notes

1. Key Terms
Parent Class (Superclass): The main class whose properties and methods are inherited.

Child Class (Subclass/Derived Class): The class that inherits from the parent class by passing the parent's name in parentheses.

2. Practical Example: Car & Toyota
A Car class is created with attributes like color and methods like start() and stop()

A Toyota class is then created, inheriting from Car. This allows the Toyota object to access Car's methods (start, stop) and variables (color) directly.

Methods are accessed using object.method_name(), while variables are accessed using print(object.variable_name)

3. Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from only one parent class.

Multi-level Inheritance: A chain where Class C inherits from Class B, and Class B inherits from Class A

Multiple Inheritance: A single child class inherits from two or more different parent classes simultaneously.

4. The super() Function
Purpose: Used to access the constructor and variables of the parent class from within the child class.

Example: In a Programmer class inheriting from ProgrammingLanguage, super().__init__(name) is used to pass the name variable to the parent's constructor while the child handles its own additional variables (like age)
This ensures that the parent class is correctly initialized even when creating an object of the child class.

Notes

1. Core Characteristics of Sets
Uniqueness: Sets do not allow duplicate values; they only store unique elements.

Single Entity: Used to treat multiple unique values as a single entity.

Heterogeneous Data: Like lists, sets can store different data types (e.g., integers, strings).

No Indexing/Slicing: Unlike lists or tuples, sets are unordered, so indexing and slicing do not work.

Syntax: Sets are defined using curly braces {}.

2. Creation and Type Casting
Verification: Use type() to confirm a variable is a set.

List to Set Conversion: You can convert a list to a set using the set() function, which is useful for removing duplicates from a list.

Empty Set Caution: Creating an empty set with {} results in a dictionary type. To create a truly empty set, you must use the set() constructor.

3. Built-in Set Functions
add(value): Adds a new element to the set. Unlike lists, the element may not necessarily appear at the end due to the unordered nature of sets.

copy(): Copies the set to the clipboard or a new variable.

remove(value): Deletes a specific element from the set.

discard(value): Similar to remove, it removes a specific item from the set.

clear(): Removes all elements from the set, leaving it empty.



Examples

s = {"name", 10}

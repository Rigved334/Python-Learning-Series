Notes

1. What is an Exception?
An exception is an unexpected or unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of a program.

Exception Handling is the process of managing these events so the program can continue running instead of crashing.

2. Example: ZeroDivisionError
Attempting to divide a number by zero (e.g., 10 / 0) is a common cause of a ZeroDivisionError.

Without handling, this error will stop the program immediately and show an error message.

3. Core Keywords for Handling Exceptions
try Block: This is where you place "risky code" that might cause an error.

except Block: This block catches a specific error (like ZeroDivisionError) and executes an alternative piece of code to handle it gracefully.

Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different types of potential errors.

finally Block: This block contains "mandatory code" that will always run, whether an exception was raised or not.

4. Benefits of Exception Handling
It ensures the program remains stable and doesn't crash unexpectedly.

It allows developers to provide user-friendly error messages instead of technical system logs.

Notes

1. Introduction to Files
Files serve as permanent data storage.

Two main types of files:

Text Files: Store text data.

Binary Files: Store non-text data like photos and videos.

2. Opening and Closing Files
Syntax: f = open("filename", "mode")

Always close a file after operations are complete using f.close() to free up resources.

3. File Modes for Text Files
'r' (Read): Opens a file for reading (default)

'w' (Write): Opens a file for writing; creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.

'a' (Append): Opens a file to add data to the end without overwriting existing content.

'r+': Reading and writing without overwriting.

'w+': Reading and writing with overwriting.

'a+': Appending and reading without overwriting original data.

Binary Modes: Similar to text modes but with a 'b' suffix (e.g., 'rb', 'wb')

4. Writing to a File
Use the write() function to add content: f.write("Your text here")

The video demonstrates creating subject.txt and writing "Python Programming" into it.

5. Reading from a File
read(): Reads the entire file content or n characters.

readline(): Reads a single line from the file.

readlines(): Reads all lines and returns them as a list.

6. The with Statement
Syntax: with open("filename", "mode") as f:

Key Advantage: It automatically closes the file once the block of code is finished, even if an error occurs.

This is the recommended way to handle files in Python to avoid forgetting f.close()

Notes

1. Types of Variables in OOP
Instance Variables: These variables differ from one object to another. For example, if two student objects are created, one can have the name "Python" and the other "Java."

Static (Class) Variables: These are defined inside the class but outside any method. They act like global variables for all methods within the class. You access them using the class name (e.g., ClassName.variable_name) [01:09]. Changes made to a static variable reflect across all instances.

Local Variables: Variables defined inside a specific method to perform a particular task. They are not accessible outside that method. The video demonstrates that if a local variable and an instance variable share the same name, the local one is used if called without self.

2. Garbage Collection
Python has a built-in "assistant" called the Garbage Collector that runs continuously in the background.

Its primary role is to automatically delete useless or unnecessary objects to free up memory, reducing the chances of program failure.

3. Destructors
Syntax: Defined using def __del__(self):

Like a constructor, a destructor runs automatically.

Purpose: It is not used to delete the object itself but to perform clean-up activities such as deallocating resources or closing database connections before the object is removed from memory.

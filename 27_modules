Notes

1. What is a Module?
A module is a Python file (.py) that contains reusable code, including methods, variables, and classes.

They help organize code by allowing developers to split large programs into multiple files.

2. Types of Modules
Built-in Modules: Pre-installed with the Python software (e.g., math, os, sys, datetime)

User-defined Modules: Created by the user to meet specific requirements.

Third-party Modules: Stored on the internet and must be downloaded via a terminal using the command pip install module_name (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn)

3. Ways to Import Modules
import module_name: Imports the whole module. Access components using module_name.method() (e.g., math.sqrt())

from module_name import *: Imports everything from the module. Components can be accessed directly without the module name prefix.

from module_name import specific_method: Imports only a specific function (e.g., from math import pow). You can then use the function directly.

import module_name as alias: Assigns a short name (alias) to a module for easier reference (e.g., import math as m), which is useful for modules with long names.

4. Practical Example
The video demonstrates using the math module's pow function to calculate powers, showing how different import styles affect how you call the function in your code.

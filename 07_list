Notes

1. List Features & Basics
Definition: A list treats different or same data types as a single entity.

Duplicates: Lists allow duplicate elements.

Creation: You can create an empty list using square brackets [].

Type Checking: Use the type() function to verify that a variable is a list.

Heterogeneous Data: A single list can store strings, integers, floats, and booleans simultaneously.

2. Built-in List Functions
len(): Returns the number of elements in the list.

count(value): Counts how many times a specific value appears in the list.

index(value): Finds the index position of the first occurrence of a value.

append(value): Adds an element to the end of the list.

insert(index, value): Adds an element at a specific index, shifting existing elements to the right.

extend(list): Merges another list into the current list.

remove(value): Removes the first occurrence of a specific value from the list.

pop(index): Similar to remove, but takes an index instead of a value to remove an element.

reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the original list.

sort(): Arranges elements in ascending order.

Note: This function will cause an error if the list contains incompatible data types (e.g., mixing strings and integers). It works perfectly on lists containing only numbers.



Examples

l = ["name", 10, 67.5, True]

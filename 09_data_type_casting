Notes

This video is the 9th installment of the Python learning series, focusing on Type Casting (also known as Type Conversion).

Summary
The tutorial explains that Type Casting is the process of converting one data type into another. It demonstrates several successful conversions, such as converting a string to an integer, a float to an integer, and a value to a boolean. It also covers the limitations of type casting, specifically when trying to convert incompatible data types like a text-based string into an integer.

Detailed Notes
1. Introduction to Type Casting
Definition: Type casting allows you to change a variable from one data type to another.

2. Practical Examples
String to Integer:

A string containing a numeric value (e.g., "10") can be converted using the int() function.

After conversion, the type changes from <class 'str'> to <class 'int'>.

Float to Integer:

A floating-point number (e.g., 123.456) can be converted to an integer using int().

Result: The decimal part is removed, leaving only the whole number (e.g., 123).

Boolean Conversion:

Using the bool() function on a non-zero variable returns True.

The converted variable will have the data type <class 'bool'>.

3. Limitations and Errors
Incompatible Types: You cannot convert a string consisting of letters (e.g., "Python") into an integer.

Error Message: Attempting this results in a ValueError because a word cannot be represented as a number.
Core Rule: Type casting only works when there is a logical relationship between the data types.



Examples

ten = "10"
print(type(ten)) --> str data type
number = int(ten)
print(type(integer)) --> int data type

Notes

1. Types of Arguments (Parameters)
Positional Arguments: The values are assigned to parameters based on their order. For example, in add(a, b), calling add(10, 20) assigns 10 to a and 20 to b

Keyword Arguments: Values are assigned to parameters using their names, allowing the order to be changed without affecting the outcome. Example: greet(name="Python", message="Good Morning")

Default Arguments: You can provide a default value to a parameter during function definition. If no value is passed when the function is called, the default is used. Example: def wish(name="Guest")

Variable-Length Arguments (*args): Used when you don't know how many arguments will be passed. It is defined using an asterisk (e.g., *n) and stores arguments in a tuple, which can be iterated through (e.g., for summing multiple numbers)

2. Types of Variables
Global Variables: Defined outside of any function. They can be accessed by any function within the same script.

Local Variables: Defined inside a function. They are only accessible within that specific function and cannot be used by other functions or the main script, leading to an error if accessed outside their scope.

3. Key Takeaway
Understanding argument types allows for more flexible function calls, while knowing variable scope (Global vs. Local) is crucial for managing data and avoiding "not defined" errors.

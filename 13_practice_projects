Notes

1. Handling User Input & Display
The first step in many programs is interacting with the user to get data.

The input() Function: Used to take data from the user. By default, it takes input as a string.

Type Casting: It is recommended to convert the input to the required data type (e.g., str, int, or float) immediately.

Code:

name = str(input("Your Name: "))
print("Hello", name)
Output: Asks for a name and then prints a greeting [01:43].


2. Project: Calculate Rectangle Area
This project applies user input and arithmetic operators to a geometry problem.

Goal: Calculate the area of a rectangle using user-provided length and width.

Implementation: The instructor uses float() for type casting to allow decimal values for more precision.

Code:

length = float(input("Enter length: "))
width = float(input("Enter width: "))
area = length * width
print("Area:", area, "unit square")
Example: Length = 10, Width = 4 → Output: 40.0 unit square.


3. Project: Temperature Conversion
This project demonstrates using mathematical formulas within a script.

Goal: Convert temperature from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C).

Formula: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9.

Implementation:

f = float(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9
print("The temperature in Celsius is", c, "degree Celsius")
Example: 100°F results in approximately 37.77°C.

Key Takeaway
The instructor highlights that implementation is more important than just watching theory. Practicing these small projects helps in building the logic required for complex programming.

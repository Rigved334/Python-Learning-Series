Notes

1. Core Conditional Statements
There are three primary keywords used for conditional logic in Python

if: The starting point; it executes a block of code only if the condition is true.

elif (Short for "else if"): Checks another condition if the previous if or elif condition was false.

else: The fallback block that executes if none of the preceding conditions are met.


2. Syntax and Indentation
Indentation is crucial in Python to define blocks of code within a statement.

Colon (:): Every conditional statement must end with a colon.

Indentation Rule: After the colon, the next line must be indented (usually by 4 spaces or 1 tab). If you are using a simple text editor like Notepad, you must add these spaces manually.

General Syntax:

if condition1:
    statement1
elif condition2:
    statement2
else:
    final_statement

    
3. Practical Example: Name Checker
The instructor demonstrates a program that takes a name as input and responds differently based on the value provided.

name = str(input("Enter your name: "))

if name == "Python":
    print("Hello Python")
elif name == "Java":
    print("Hello Java")
else:
    print("Hello", name)
    
How it works:

If you enter "Python", the first condition is met, and it prints "Hello Python".

If you enter "Java", the if fails, the elif succeeds, and it prints "Hello Java".

If you enter anything else (e.g., your own name), both if and elif fail, triggering the else block to print "Hello [Your Name]".

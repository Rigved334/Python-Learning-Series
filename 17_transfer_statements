Notes

1. The break Statement
The break keyword is used to terminate a loop entirely when a specific condition is met.

Function: It stops the execution of the loop and moves the program flow to the next block of code after the loop.


2. The continue Statement
The continue keyword is used to skip the remaining code inside the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.

Function: Unlike break, it does not stop the loop. It only skips the specific part of the loop for the current value of the index.


Key Takeaway
Use break to exit a loop completely.

Use continue to skip one specific turn of the loop and keep going.



Examples

for i in range(10):
    if i == 7:
        break
    print(i)
Explanation: This loop is set to run from 0 to 9. However, when i reaches 7, the break statement triggers, ending the loop.

Output: Numbers from 0 to 6 are printed. The number 7 and those following it are skipped because the loop has been killed


for i in range(10):
    if i == 7:
        continue
    print(i)
Output: Prints all numbers from 0 to 9, except for 7


for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0: # Checks if the number is even
        continue
    print(i)
Explanation: For every even number (where the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), the continue statement skips the print(i) function.

Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (only odd numbers)

Notes

1. Syntax of the for Loop
The basic structure of a for loop involves the for keyword, followed by an index variable (commonly named i), the in keyword, and a sequence.

Indentation: Just like conditional statements, the code block inside the loop must be indented after the colon.

General Format:

for i in sequence:
    # Code block to execute

    
2. Iterating Over a String
When you use a for loop on a string, it processes each character one by one.

Execution Flow: The index i starts at the 0th position (the first character) and moves to the next until the end of the string.


3. Using the range() Function
The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

Inclusive/Exclusive: If you provide one argument (e.g., range(10)), it generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 10

Why 10 is excluded: As learned in indexing and slicing, the end index is always excluded in Python.


4. Visualization of the Loop
The instructor explains that the loop essentially checks if the current index exists within the sequence or range. If it does, the code block executes; if not (e.g., when reaching the end index), the loop terminates.


Examples

string = "Python"
for i in string:
    print(i)
Output: Each letter of "Python" is printed on a new line

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
Output: Numbers from 0 to 9 are printed

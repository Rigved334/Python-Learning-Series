Notes

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for performing mathematical calculations.

Integer Division (//): Divides and truncates the result to the nearest lowest integer.

Exponentiation (**): Raises the first number to the power of the second.

Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division.


2. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements [02:04].

and: Returns True if both conditions are true [02:22].

or: Returns True if at least one condition is true [02:29].

not: Reverses the logical state; used when you don't want a specific condition.


3. Equality Operators
Used to compare if values are exactly the same.

== (Absolutely Equal): Returns True if the values are identical.

!= (Not Equal): Returns True if the values are different.


4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign and update values to variables.

Standard: a = 1

Shorthand: a += 1 (equivalent to a = a + 1)

Other shorthands include -=, *=, and /=


5. Ternary Operators
A one-liner version of an if-else statement to assign values based on a condition.

Syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false.


6. Identity Operators
Used to compare the memory locations (identities) of two objects.

is: Returns True if both variables point to the same object.

is not: Returns True if they do not point to the same object.


7. Membership Operators
Used to test if a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) is present in an object.

in: Returns True if the value is found.

not in: Returns True if the value is not found.



Examples

5 // 2 results in 2.
2 ** 3 results in 8
17 % 6 results in 5

10 == 10 is True
10 != 5 is True

x = 50 if a < b else 100. If a < b is true, x becomes 50, otherwise it's 100

'I' in "Hello I am using Python" is True

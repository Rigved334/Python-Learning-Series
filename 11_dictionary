This video is the 11th part of a Python learning series, focusing on the Dictionary data type, its characteristics, and how to use its built-in functions.

Notes

1. Introduction to Dictionaries
Definition: Dictionaries store data in key: value pairs.

Unique Keys: Keys cannot be duplicated within a dictionary, but values can be repeated.

Mutability: Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their content after they are created.

2. Creating and Adding Elements
Empty Dictionary: Created using empty curly brackets: d = {}.

Note: Even though sets also use curly brackets, an empty {} defaults to a dictionary in Python.

Adding Data: You can add elements by assigning a value to a specific key, for example: d['name'] = 'Python'.

Accessing Data: Instead of using numeric indices (0, 1, 2...), you access values using their associated key names, such as d['name'].

3. Built-in Dictionary Functions
clear(): This function removes all entries from the dictionary, leaving it empty.

del: Unlike clear(), the del keyword deletes the entire dictionary object from memory. Attempting to access it afterward will result in an error.

get('key'): Retrieves the value associated with a specific key.

keys(): Returns a list-like object containing all the keys present in the dictionary.



Examples

d = {"name": "python", "age": 18}

values(): Returns a list-like object containing all the values stored in the dictionary.

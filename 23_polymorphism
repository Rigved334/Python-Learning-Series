Notes

1. What is Polymorphism?
The term is derived from "Poly" (many) and "Morphism" (forms)

It allows a single method name to represent multiple implementations.

2. Method Overloading
Definition: Occurs when two or more methods have the same name but different parameters or arguments.

In Python: Since Python doesn't support traditional method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name coexist), it is achieved using:

Variable-Length Arguments (*args): Allowing a function to accept a flexible number of inputs.

Default Arguments: Providing default values to parameters.

Example: An add class with a sum method that can handle any number of arguments and return their total sum.

3. Method Overriding
Definition: Occurs during Inheritance when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.

Requirement: The method name and parameters must be exactly the same in both the parent and child classes.

Example: A parent class Shape has a method number_of_sides() that prints a general message. A child class Square overrides this method to specifically print that a square has four sides. When the method is called on a Square object, the child’s version is executed instead of the parent’s.

4. Key Difference
Overloading happens within the same class (or via flexible arguments) to handle different inputs.

Overriding happens across different classes (Parent vs. Child) to provide specific behavior.

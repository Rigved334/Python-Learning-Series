Easy to read & write: Clean syntax, less boilerplate, fast to learn.

Interpreted language: Runs without manual compilation (good for quick testing and scripting).

High-level language: You don’t manage memory manually like C/C++.

Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types (x = 10 is valid). Flexible, but type mistakes can show up at runtime.

Object-Oriented + Multi-paradigm: Supports OOP, procedural, and functional programming.

Huge standard library: Built-in modules for files, OS work, math, JSON, networking, etc.

Massive ecosystem (third-party libraries): For AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch), web (Django, Flask), data (NumPy, Pandas), automation, etc.

Cross-platform: Same code works on Windows, Linux, macOS (mostly).

Free and open-source: No licensing cost, huge community support.

Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection): Python handles unused memory automatically.

Interactive mode (REPL): You can run Python line-by-line for testing.

Extensible & embeddable: Can call C/C++ for speed, and Python can be embedded into other apps.

Great for rapid development: You build working projects faster compared to many languages.

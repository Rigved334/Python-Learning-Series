Encapsulation and Absraction in Python

Notes

1. Encapsulation
Definition: Wrapping data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class)

Access Modifiers in Python:

Protected (_attribute): Suggested for use only within the class and its subclasses.

Private (__attribute): Strictly restricted; cannot be accessed directly outside the class.

Practical Example (Bank Account):

By naming a balance attribute __balance, it becomes private.

Attempting to access a.__balance from outside the class results in an AttributeError, ensuring the data is protected.

Private attributes can still be accessed and displayed via methods defined inside the class (like a display() method)

2. Abstraction
Definition: Hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality to the user.

Real-World Analogy: When driving a car, a user knows how to use the accelerator, brakes, and steering wheel (interface) but doesn't necessarily need to understand the internal mechanics of the engine (implementation)

Python Implementation:

The user interacts with high-level methods like drive() or stop()

The complex logic behind these actions is hidden within the class structure, allowing the user to focus on "what" the program does rather than "how" it does it.

3. Conclusion of the Python Series
This video marks the completion of the core Python series, covering topics from basics to advanced OOP.

Future videos will focus on specific Python modules based on viewer feedback.
